Project Description:
 
Our app will display random numbers and requires the user to type them in, in the same order they were displayed in. The app will start by displaying 1 number which the user then has to input. After correctly inputting the number a second number will be added to the sequence. The user then must correctly input both numbers in the right order (order is randomly generated by the program). This continues until the user inputs the numbers in the wrong order in which the game will end. They will be taken back to the main menu and can choose to play again
